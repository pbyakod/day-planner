# Worklife Calendar

### Short Description 

This project aims to make people's worklife easier, by allowing them to continually plan and update their day based on the hour. The worklife calendar is a scheduling page that displays the day's normal buisness hours. Each hour contains a text field where users can enter relevant thoughts or plans, as well as a save button to store the text onto local storage. This way, they don't lose what they've scheduled incase they accidentally cancel or refresh the website. 

### User Story
```
- AS AN employee with a busy schedule
- I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
- SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```
### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN I open the planner

- THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
